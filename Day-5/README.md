# Personalization Logic (PLI)

- **L Value**: 13  
  The value of **L** is calculated as the length of my full name **"KISHORGUNITHI"**, excluding spaces.

- **PLI Value**: 1  
  The PLI is calculated using the formula:  
  `PLI = L % 3 = 13 % 3 = 1`

- **Applied Rule (Rule B)**:  
  Since **PLI = 1**, all **Very Light packages (0–5 kg)** are removed from the final loading plan.  
  These entries remain valid but are excluded to maintain balanced transport loading.
